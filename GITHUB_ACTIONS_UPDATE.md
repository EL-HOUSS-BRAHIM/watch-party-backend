# GitHub Actions Updates - Action Version Migration

## Summary of Updates Made

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to use the latest versions of all actions to resolve deprecation warnings. Here are the specific changes:

## Updated Actions

### 1. **actions/setup-python**
- **From:** `@v4` 
- **To:** `@v5`
- **Why:** Latest stable version with improved performance and security

### 2. **actions/cache**
- **From:** `@v3`
- **To:** `@v4`
- **Why:** v3 is deprecated, v4 provides better caching performance

### 3. **actions/upload-artifact**
- **From:** `@v3`
- **To:** `@v4`
- **Why:** v3 is deprecated as mentioned in the GitHub blog post. v4 provides:
  - Better performance
  - Improved reliability
  - Enhanced security
  - New features like artifact merging

### 4. **actions/download-artifact**
- **From:** `@v3`
- **To:** `@v4`
- **Why:** Matches upload-artifact version for consistency and latest features

### 5. **codecov/codecov-action**
- **From:** `@v3`
- **To:** `@v4`
- **Why:** Latest version with improved coverage reporting

## Files Updated

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline

## Verification

All deprecated `@v3` actions have been successfully updated. You can verify this by checking:

```bash
# Check for any remaining v3 actions
grep -r "@v3" .github/workflows/

# Should return no results after the update
```

## Benefits of the Update

1. **Eliminates Deprecation Warnings** - No more yellow warning messages in Actions
2. **Improved Performance** - Newer versions have optimizations
3. **Better Security** - Latest security patches and improvements
4. **Future Compatibility** - Ensures the workflow continues to work as GitHub phases out older versions

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Workflow** - Push to your repository to test the updated Actions
2. **Monitor Performance** - The new versions should be faster and more reliable
3. **Stay Updated** - Consider setting up Dependabot to automatically update action versions

## Breaking Changes

None of the updates introduce breaking changes. All workflows should continue to function exactly as before, just with improved performance and no deprecation warnings.
