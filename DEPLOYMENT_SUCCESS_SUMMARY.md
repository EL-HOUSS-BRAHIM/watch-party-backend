# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution
Successfully fixed the deployment error where the watchparty-gunicorn.service was failing to start.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Virtual Environment Issues
- **Problem**: The virtual environment was corrupted or incomplete, missing the gunicorn executable
- **Solution**: Recreated the virtual environment from scratch and reinstalled all dependencies
- **Commands executed on server**:
  ```bash
  cd /var/www/watchparty
  rm -rf venv
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 2. Log File Permissions
- **Problem**: Django app couldn't write to log files due to permission issues
- **Solution**: Fixed ownership and permissions for log directory
- **Commands executed on server**:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /var/log/watchparty
  sudo chmod -R 664 /var/log/watchparty/*
  ```

### 3. Systemd Service Configuration
- **Problem**: The gunicorn service file had line breaks in the ExecStart command causing execution failures
- **Solution**: Fixed the service file to have the ExecStart command on a single line
- **Fixed service file**: `/etc/systemd/system/watchparty-gunicorn.service`

### 4. Port Conflicts
- **Problem**: Both gunicorn and daphne were trying to use port 8001, causing conflicts
- **Solution**: 
  - Gunicorn: Port 8001 (HTTP/API traffic)
  - Daphne: Port 8002 (WebSocket traffic)
  - Updated nginx configuration to proxy correctly

### 5. Nginx Configuration
- **Problem**: Nginx was proxying to port 8000 but services were on different ports
- **Solution**: Updated nginx configuration:
  - Main application traffic → gunicorn on port 8001
  - WebSocket traffic (`/ws/`) → daphne on port 8002

## Services Successfully Running

✅ **watchparty-gunicorn.service** - Django application server
- Status: Active (running) 
- Port: 8001
- Workers: 3 with gevent worker class

✅ **watchparty-celery.service** - Background task processing
- Status: Active (running)
- Workers: 4 processes

✅ **watchparty-daphne.service** - WebSocket server  
- Status: Active (running)
- Port: 8002

✅ **nginx.service** - Reverse proxy and web server
- Status: Active (running)
- Properly routing traffic to backend services

## Current Status

- **Application**: Successfully deployed and running
- **Health Check**: Responding with 301 redirect to HTTPS (expected behavior)
- **Services**: All critical services are running and enabled for auto-start
- **Configuration**: Properly configured for production environment

## Remaining Infrastructure Issue

The application is running correctly on the server but not accessible from external networks due to security group configuration. The AWS security groups need to allow inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).

## Verification Commands

To verify the deployment is working:

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status watchparty-gunicorn.service
sudo systemctl status watchparty-celery.service  
sudo systemctl status watchparty-daphne.service

# Test local connectivity
curl -I http://localhost  # Should return 301 redirect to HTTPS

# Check listening ports
sudo ss -tlnp | grep -E ":(8001|8002)"
```

## Next Steps

1. **AWS Security Groups**: Configure inbound rules to allow:
   - Port 80 (HTTP) from 0.0.0.0/0
   - Port 443 (HTTPS) from 0.0.0.0/0

2. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure SSL certificate is properly configured (Let's Encrypt or AWS Certificate Manager)

3. **Domain DNS**: Verify DNS is pointing to the correct server IP

The deployment itself is now **successful** - the issue is infrastructure/networking configuration, not the application deployment.
