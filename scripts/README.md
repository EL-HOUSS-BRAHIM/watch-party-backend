```

## 🔧 Global Options

All scripts support these global options:

```bash
--verbose      # Enable verbose output
--dry-run      # Show what would be done without executing
--force        # Skip confirmation prompts
--help         # Show help information
```

Examples:
```bash
./manage.sh backup --verbose            # Verbose backup
./manage.sh clean --dry-run             # See what would be cleaned
./manage.sh wipeout --force             # Force wipeout without prompts
```

## 📝 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Scripts respect these environment variables:

- `VERBOSE`: Enable verbose output
- `DRY_RUN`: Show operations without executing
- `FORCE`: Skip confirmations
- `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`: Django settings module

### Customization
You can customize script behavior by:

1. Setting environment variables
2. Modifying script configuration sections
3. Creating local override files

## 🔍 Examples

### Complete New Project Setup
```bash
# Initial setup
./manage.sh setup --with-superuser

# Start development
./manage.sh dev

# In another terminal, monitor logs
./manage.sh logs django
```

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Morning routine
./manage.sh status                      # Check project status
./manage.sh migrate                     # Apply any new migrations
./manage.sh dev                         # Start development server

# Before committing
./manage.sh test                        # Run tests
./manage.sh clean                       # Clean up files

# End of day
./manage.sh backup                      # Create backup
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Prepare deployment
./manage.sh check                       # Health check
./manage.sh test                        # Run tests
./manage.sh deploy                      # Create deployment package

# Deploy to server
./manage.sh deploy-to user@server       # Direct deployment

# Check deployment
./manage.sh status user@server          # Verify deployment
```

### Maintenance Operations
```bash
# Weekly cleanup
./manage.sh clean deep                  # Deep cleanup

# Monthly backup cleanup
./manage.sh backup clean 30             # Remove old backups

# Health monitoring
./manage.sh monitor                     # Live monitoring dashboard
```

### Emergency Operations
```bash
# Quick diagnostics
./manage.sh status                      # Quick status
./manage.sh logs error                  # Check for errors

# Restore from backup
./manage.sh backup list                 # List available backups
./manage.sh restore backup_file.tar.gz  # Restore specific backup

# Complete reset (development only)
./manage.sh wipeout                     # Remove all data
./manage.sh setup                       # Fresh setup
```

## 🚨 Safety Features

### Confirmation Prompts
Destructive operations require explicit confirmation:
- Wipeout operations require typing "YES I UNDERSTAND"
- Nuclear operations require typing "DELETE"
- Use `--force` to skip prompts (use carefully)

### Backup Integration
- Automatic backups before destructive operations
- Backup verification and integrity checks
- Easy restore functionality

### Dry Run Mode
Test operations safely:
```bash
./manage.sh wipeout --dry-run           # See what would be deleted
./manage.sh clean --dry-run             # See what would be cleaned
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
./manage.sh monitor                     # Live dashboard
./manage.sh logs django                 # Follow Django logs
./manage.sh logs error                  # Monitor errors
```

### Health Checks
```bash
./manage.sh check                       # Comprehensive health check
./manage.sh status                      # Quick status
./manage.sh stats                       # Project statistics
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Virtual Environment Issues:**
```bash
./manage.sh setup venv                  # Recreate virtual environment
```

**Database Issues:**
```bash
./manage.sh check database              # Check database connectivity
./manage.sh reset                       # Reset database (development)
```

**Permission Issues:**
```bash
./manage.sh check permissions           # Check file permissions
chmod +x manage.sh scripts/*.sh         # Fix script permissions
```

**Log File Issues:**
```bash
./manage.sh logs                        # Check all logs
./manage.sh clean logs                  # Clean log files
```

### Getting Help
```bash
./manage.sh help                        # Main help
./scripts/[script-name].sh help         # Script-specific help
```

## 📈 Advanced Usage

### Scripting and Automation
```bash
# Automated deployment script
#!/bin/bash
./manage.sh check || exit 1
./manage.sh test || exit 1
./manage.sh backup
./manage.sh deploy
```

### Custom Scripts
You can add custom scripts to the `scripts/` directory following the same pattern:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Custom script template
# Add to scripts/ directory and make executable
```

### Integration with CI/CD
The management system integrates well with CI/CD pipelines:
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Setup and Test
  run: |
    ./manage.sh setup --force
    ./manage.sh test
    ./manage.sh check
```
